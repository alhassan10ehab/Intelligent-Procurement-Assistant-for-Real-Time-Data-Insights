### Problem Description
Organizations managing extensive procurement operations often face challenges in efficiently extracting insights from large amounts of purchasing data. Important metrics such as order volumes, high-spending periods, and frequently ordered items are critical for informed decision-making, but manually analyzing this data can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an intelligent chat assistant that automates the retrieval of procurement insights. The assistant allows users to ask procurement-related questions and receive immediate, data-driven responses, empowering procurement teams to make faster and more informed decisions.

### Objective
To create a prototype chat assistant capable of answering queries related to procurement data. This includes:
- Total number of orders within specified periods.
- Identifying the quarter with the highest spending.
- Analyzing frequently ordered line items.
- Answering other relevant procurement-related inquiries.
